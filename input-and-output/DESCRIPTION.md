This module will teach you about input, output, and variables in Python.

- `input`: Data that is given to your program, either by the user or from a file
- `output`: Data that your program displays to the user
- `variable`: A place to store data. This allows your program to access and process that data as needed

All challenges will require you to make your own python file with the `.py` extension. You can name these files whatever you want. In challenges when you see `yourFile.py`, replace that with the file you made!
To run a python file: `python [file_name].py`.
