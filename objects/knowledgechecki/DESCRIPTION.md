# Knowledge Check I

Now that you have a grasp of the basics, let's try and tie them together!

1. Create a `Fish` class.
2. Give it the following attributes:
	- `color`
	- `length`
	- `type` (Walleye, Bass, etc.)
	- `is_swimming` (set it to False by default)
	- `is_eating` (set it to Fales by default)
3. Program the following methods:
	- `swim` (Set is_swimming to True, and is_eating to False)
	- `eat` (Set is_eating to True, and is_swimming to False)
4. Create two unique instances of the `Fish` class and run `swim` and `eat` on both.

Once you are done, run `/challenge/verify <your_python_file>` to verify your code and receive the flag!
